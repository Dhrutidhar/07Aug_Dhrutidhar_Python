# Q 16.) Write a Python program to count the occurrences of each word in a given sentence.


str = '''One important aspect of Life is that it keeps going forward. This means nothing is permanent. 
Hence, there should be a reason to stay in dejection. A happy occasion will come to pass, just like a sad one.

Every situation, occasion, and event shall pass. This is certainly a beauty of Life.'''

length = len(str.split(" "))
print(length)
