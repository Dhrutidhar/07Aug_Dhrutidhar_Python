# Q 15.) Write a Python program to count occurrences of a substring in a string.


sub = """People became poor for different poor reasons and often they are not responsible for what happening with them. 
When we help poor people, we became better, more moral and . Helping poor helps us to remember poor that there is another 
side of life and that we can face poor with familiar grief in any time."""

#print(sub)

substr = input("Enter the word to find: ")
print("The occurance of substring is : ", sub.count(substr))
